# Back end part only

This is a working prototype of an app querying GitHub API. The UI is practically non-existant - app's purpose is to show GitHub API features.

## Few simple steps

1. Clone this project
2. Do `composer install`
3. Start PHP webserver `php bin/console server:start`
4. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and take it from there
5. Check out the routes to have an understanding of what an app does

Built using Symfony 3.4

@todo:
- combine API calls together
